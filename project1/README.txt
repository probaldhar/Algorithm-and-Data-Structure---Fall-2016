1. The vectorADTArray is working on my pc but not working on the servers, it freezes the window after waiting some time when getting input from the file. I tried my best to solve it and tried hours to solve but somehow I failed. Here you can find screenshot : https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/80743255/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-11%20at%209.15.08%20PM.png
Itâ€™s the same program.

2. The vectorADTLL is adding the element, next search for the the elements to search and then in the removing part it's giving segmentation fault.
